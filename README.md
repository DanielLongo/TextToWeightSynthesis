Autmotamed weight initilization from text descriptions. 
Synthesize weights from text with a VAE like approach.

text description -> vectorizer -> weight synthesizer -> apply weights -> reconstruct original text -> get reconstruction loss

TODOs:
[x] create simple vectorizer
[x] create deep nn weight syntheiszer
[x] create apply weights function
[x] reconstrict original text
[x] get reconstruction loss
[ ] optimize
[ ] train with descriptions
[ ] test with real dataset
[ ] try decoding weights
[ ] try convolutional architecture
[ ] try synthesizing deep architectures
